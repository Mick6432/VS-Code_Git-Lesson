I)  To check if git is installed and what version is running.
        Open a terminal window and type:
                git --version
		If the version returns you are good to go.
		If not, git has to be installed on your computer.
				
II) Create Local Repository (On your machine.)
		Within your working folder
			Click on Initialize Repository (Referred to as a git init)
			Click the (âˆš) check to commit modified code to the repository.
			(Type a message to yourself about the code you are commiting in the message box.)
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
		Side Note:
			If running git for the first time on this computer your commit will fail.
			Go to the output tab on the terminal window and find these 2 lines:
			
				git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
				git config --global user.name "Your Name"
				
			Replace you@example.com with your github email address.
			Replace Your Name with your github username.
			
				git config --global user.email "mick6432a@gmail.com"
				git config --global user.name "Mick6432"
				
			Go back to the terminal window and type the above lines in one at a time.
			(Could also cut and paste the lines right from here. Just do them one at a time.)
			Then retry the commit.

		Make sure you are in the directory where you want to link the local repository
		and the remote repository.
        Open a terminal and type the following 2 commands:
            (The address in the first command must match the location where you created
             the repository on github.)
               1) git remote add origin https://github.com/Mick6432/[Name of repository created on github]
               2) git push -u origin master
				EXAMPLE:
					git remote add origin https://github.com/Mick6432/DevU-Javascript.git
